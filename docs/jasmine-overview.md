# Overview

grunt-contrib-jasmine automatically builds and maintains your spec runner and runs your tests headlessly through
phantomjs

Substantial credit goes to [Camille Reynders](http://creynders.be/) (@creynders) for the first decent implementation
of jasmine through grunt which served as motivation for all the future work.

## Run specs locally or on an ad hoc server

Run your tests on your local filesystem or via a server task like [grunt-contrib-connect][].

## AMD Support

Includes a SpecRunner template customized for use with AMD modules and requirejs.

## Customize your SpecRunner with your own template

Supply your own underscore template to automatically build your SpecRunner custom to your use.

## Example application usage
